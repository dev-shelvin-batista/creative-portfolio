## Instructions

To run the frontend project, follow these steps:

- Clone the project, either with the command git clone `https://github.com/dev-shelvin-batista/creative-portfolio.git` or using a GitHub graphical tool.
- It is recommended to install and use a local server for testing, such as Wampserver, Xampp, or Apache, as a server is required to obtain data such as RESTful services. Otherwise, a browser security error will occur when attempting to access the URL. 
- Copy the generated folder to the installed server folder.
- Use the default URL of the installed local server, for example: `http://localhost/creative-portfolio/`
